# Analysis-of-Health-Insurance-Marketplace
An in depth analysis of the abstract data set on kaggle which was provided by the US Department of Health and Human Services. This is me and my friend's humble attempt to analyze the data set and to get more familiar with data mining and data visualizations with the help of R and also gain more knowledge and insights on the data set.

This project includes all the R code files that were required for the execution of the project. Also there is a pdf report included which also contains all the details of all the anlytical methods, visulizations and all the other details which are necessary for the project.
